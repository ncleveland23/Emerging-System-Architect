# Emerging-System-Architect

# Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.

  For this project we were asked to write interface software to control hardware components. We were also asked to analyze fundamental considerations regarding         hardware architecture design and their impact on application performance. We were then asked to recommend and justify emerging systems architectures and technologies based on business requirements. This was all to be completed by creating the software to make a thermostat.
  
# What did you do particularly well?

  For this project I did well implementing the Timer, I2C, and the UART into the software. Unfortunately, I was unable to get the overall thermostat to work.
  
# Where could you improve?

  I could improve by going back and trying to figure out where the programming was not working. I could do more research on the UART and I2C to help with figuring this out.

# What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects and/or course work?

  The skills that are transferable from this project are the ability to analyze how the system is supposed to operate based on the requirements and then putting them into the software. 

# How did you make this project maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

  I made this project maintainable, readable, and adaptable by using comments throughout the code. I also made good use of object oriented programming.
